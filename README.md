# Wallet-Assault
I recieved a call Raymond Dwight from Raymond Dwight on Dec 26th, 2016 to go to Radioshack at Aurora Village dressed in civilian clothes to pick up a pre-ordered part. I arrived at Aurora Village shopping center and was attacked by Mikail Nickerson with a Bright Strike Device. She yelled "Your going to pay for this baby" and threw my daughter on the ground hard. She continued her attack while removing my wallet and various personal belongings. I had little idea what happened and I went to Mikail's house, where I whitnessed he touching my child and I reported her. https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=aL1Yj_1529908520 This was right after the Hillary Clinton incident.
